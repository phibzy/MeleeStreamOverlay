# Melee Stream Overlay
The first ever personal project I made - a stream overlay updater for Super Smash Bros. Melee streams.

Originally written one late night in 2014, now uploaded here for historical purposes!

Written in VB, allows for easy changing of player names, bracket stage and player icons to easily identify players on stream.

# What Would I Change if I Wrote it Again Today?

- Not write it in VB
- Instead of endless If statements, use filenames as selection options for icons
- If name consistency/readability still a problem, use hash to map readable names to relevant icon
