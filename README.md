# Melee Stream Overlay
The first ever personal project I made - a stream overlay updater for Super Smash Bros. Melee streams.

Originally written one late night in 2014, now uploaded here for historical purposes!

Written in VB, allows for easy changing of player names, bracket stage and player icons to easily identify players on stream.
